About this fork :

Changes made by Tanguy Pruvot (2011) :

New abilities :
+ Added ability to autolist normal "git clone" repositories and not only public "bare" ones.
+ Added ability to autolist subfolders (and set maximum level, to create groups of repositories)

Enhancements :
+ use origin git clone url as description
+ use git user.name as default owner
+ geshi update
+ fix line numbers sync in IE 8,9 and Chrome (11), Mozilla dont change line height if monospace text is bold or italic
  made with a new config variable "fixupjs" where we can add a jQuery script

Addons :
+ Drupal 6 geshi definitions (from Joshua Schroeder)
+ Gitweb blue skin (based on gitphp-glip, many fixes made... need some css cleanup)

TODO :

- Implement PHP glip as classes, as fallback if git executable not present/usable

- Browse .repo projects to check android platform status
  .repo folder contains all subprojects .git folders
